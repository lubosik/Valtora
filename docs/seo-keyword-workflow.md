## Prioritization Strategy

### Priority Order
1. **Transactional keywords** (highest priority)
2. **Commercial keywords** (high priority)
3. **Informational keywords** (medium priority - for content marketing)
4. **Navigational keywords** (low priority - brand protection)

### Rationale
- Transactional and commercial keywords have higher conversion potential
- These users are closer to making a purchase decision
- Better ROI on content creation and optimization efforts
- Aligns with business goals of lead generation and conversions

## Match Types Logic

When researching keywords, consider different match types to capture variations and long-tail opportunities.

### 1. Exact Match
**Definition:** Keyword matches search query exactly.

**Example:** "Dubai company formation"
**Search Query Match:** "Dubai company formation" ✓
**Search Query Match:** "Dubai company setup" ✗

**Use Case:** Primary target keywords, high-volume terms

### 2. Phrase Match
**Definition:** Keyword appears as a phrase within the search query.

**Example:** "Dubai company formation"
**Search Query Match:** "How to do Dubai company formation" ✓
**Search Query Match:** "Dubai company formation cost" ✓
**Search Query Match:** "Dubai business formation" ✗

**Use Case:** Capturing variations with core phrase intact

### 3. Broad Match
**Definition:** Keyword components appear anywhere in the search query, in any order.

**Example:** "Dubai company formation"
**Search Query Match:** "Formation of company in Dubai" ✓
**Search Query Match:** "Company Dubai formation services" ✓
**Search Query Match:** "Dubai business setup" ✗ (too broad)

**Use Case:** Discovering related search patterns, long-tail variations

### 4. Long-Tail Match
**Definition:** Specific, multi-word phrases with lower volume but higher intent.

**Example:** "How much does it cost to set up a company in Dubai free zone"
**Characteristics:**
- 4+ words typically
- Lower search volume (10-100 monthly)
- Higher conversion potential
- Less competition

**Use Case:** Niche targeting, content optimization, FAQ pages

### Choosing Match Types

**For High-Volume Keywords (>1000 monthly searches):**
- Start with exact match
- Consider phrase match for variations
- Avoid broad match (too much noise)

**For Medium-Volume Keywords (100-1000 monthly searches):**
- Phrase match preferred
- Exact match for primary targets
- Long-tail variations for content depth

**For Low-Volume Keywords (<100 monthly searches):**
- Long-tail match
- Phrase match for related terms
- Focus on conversion quality over volume

## Volume Thresholds

### Minimum Volume: 30 Monthly Searches
**Rationale:**
- Below 30 searches/month = negligible traffic potential
- Not worth content creation investment
- Focus resources on higher-opportunity keywords

**Exceptions:**
- Long-tail keywords with very high commercial/transactional intent
- Brand-related keywords (navigational)
- Keywords with high conversion potential despite low volume

### Volume Categories

**High Volume:** >1000 monthly searches
- Primary target keywords
- Homepage, main service pages
- Requires significant content investment
- High competition typically

**Medium Volume:** 100-1000 monthly searches
- Secondary target keywords
- Blog posts, service sub-pages
- Good balance of opportunity and competition
- **Sweet spot for content creation**

**Low Volume:** 30-100 monthly searches
- Long-tail opportunities
- Blog posts, FAQ pages
- Lower competition
- Higher conversion potential per visitor

## Preferring High-Volume Variants

When multiple keyword variations exist, prioritize higher-volume variants while maintaining relevance.

### Example: Free Zone Keywords

**Lower Volume:**
- "Dubai free zone company" (200 searches/month)
- "Free zone Dubai setup" (150 searches/month)

**Higher Volume (Preferred):**
- "Dubai free zone" (1,200 searches/month)
- "Dubai free zone company formation" (800 searches/month)

**Strategy:**
1. Target high-volume variant as primary keyword
2. Include lower-volume variants naturally in content
3. Create dedicated content for high-volume terms
4. Use variations in headings, meta descriptions, and body content

### Volume vs. Intent Trade-off

**Rule:** Prioritize intent over volume when:
- Volume difference is <50%
- Lower-volume keyword has significantly higher commercial/transactional intent
- Lower-volume keyword has less competition

**Example:**
- "Dubai company formation cost" (500 searches, commercial intent) ✓
- "Dubai company formation" (600 searches, mixed intent) ✗
- Choose the cost-focused keyword for better conversion potential
